Hello Damini,

I am currently a final year undergraduate in Civil Engineering at DTU, Delhi, and am actively pursuing opportunities in software development. I have experience in development using Java, JavaScript, SQL and MERN stack and Python - particularly in the context of web development and software development.

Would it be possible for you to refer me for possible opportunities at MAQ Software? I would be happy to share any further information you might require.

Regards,
Abhishek Singh
